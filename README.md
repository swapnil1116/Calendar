Calendar-Based Business Management Platform
Overview
This project is a Calendar-Based Business Management platform developed during my internship. The platform allows users to manage schedules, track visitors in apartments, handle appointments, and more. The project was designed to be highly scalable, providing a seamless experience for managing daily tasks and interactions in a business environment. The platform was built using a combination of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, and Passport.js, with a focus on providing a responsive and intuitive user interface using JavaScript, CSS3, and jQuery.

Features
  Calendar Management: Manage and schedule appointments with a robust calendar interface.
  Visitor Tracking: Track visitors entering and exiting the apartment or business premises.
  Appointment Management: Allow users to book, modify, or cancel appointments with ease.
  User Authentication: Secure user login and registration with Passport.js.
  Responsive User Interface: Built with JavaScript, CSS3, and jQuery, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices.
  MongoDB Database: Stores user data, appointments, and other business-related information in a NoSQL database.
  Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle multiple users, schedules, and appointments with ease.
Technologies Used
  Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building scalable backend services.
  Express.js: Web framework for Node.js, used to handle API requests and server-side logic.
  MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data, schedules, and appointments.
  Mongoose.js: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, used to interact with the database.
  Passport.js: Authentication middleware for handling secure user login and registration.
  JavaScript: Programming language for client-side and server-side logic.
  CSS3: Stylesheets for the frontend, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
  jQuery: JavaScript library for dynamic content and user interaction on the frontend.
  Git: Version control to manage the development of the project.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed.
MongoDB database set up (locally or via cloud service).
1. Clone the Repository
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/calendar-based-business-management.git
  cd calendar-based-business-management
2. Install Dependencies
  npm install
3. Configure Environment Variables
  Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
  DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/business_management_db
  SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
4. Start the Application
  npm start
  The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

6. Testing the Endpoints
  Use tools like Postman or cURL to test the API endpoints.
  To access protected routes (like creating appointments or tracking visitors), you need to pass a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.

Security Considerations
  User Authentication: User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
  JWT Authentication: Protects endpoints and ensures that only authenticated users can access sensitive data.
  Authorization: Role-based access control can be implemented for advanced features (e.g., admin roles to manage users and appointments).

Future Enhancements
  Add email notifications for appointment reminders.
  Implement role-based access control for different user types (e.g., admin, regular user).
  Integrate with Google Calendar API to sync appointments.
  Improve the UI/UX for better user experience.
